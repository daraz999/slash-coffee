# /food

/food is a slash command to organize food runs through slack.

Each run is created on a channel level, meaning that different channels can have separate runs simultaneously (if you have a global team, for example).

## Installation

Visit [food.agelber.com](http://food.agelber.com) and you can follow the instructions from there.

If you don't want to install this through the Slack app directory, you could deploy it on your own and add a custom integration through the Slack admin panel.

## Usage

There are 5 commands to know:

#### `/food run [time]`

Start a food run!  
example: `/food run 15`

#### `/food list`

Show the list of orders for the current run.  
example: `/food list`

#### `/food order [item]`

Order something from the current run.  
example: `/food order small cappuccino`

#### `/food here`

Let everyone know that the food is here!
This is needed so that others can start new runs later on.  
example: `/food here`

#### `/food help`

Show a help message detailing the available commands.  
example: `/food help`
